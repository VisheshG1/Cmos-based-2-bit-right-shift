# Cmos-based-2-bit-right-shift
This repository contains the design and simulation of a 2-bit right shift register using CMOS technology. A shift register is a fundamental sequential circuit used in digital systems for data storage, transfer, and signal processing. This design is optimized for low power and high-speed operation.
